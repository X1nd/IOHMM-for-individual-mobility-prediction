# IOHMM-for-individual-mobility-prediction
Input-output hidden markov model for individual mobility prediction with interpretability.

## Codes
These are codes for paper "Individual Mobility Prediction in Mass Transit Systems using Smart Card Data: An Interpretable Activity-based Hidden Markov Approach". The IOHMM codes are modified from https://github.com/Mogeng/IOHMM. The first author want to thank Mr. Mogeng Yin for the discussion about the IOHMM implementation.
